Problem:
Table: Employee

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| empId       | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| supervisor  | int     |
| salary      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
empId is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name and the ID of an employee in addition to their salary and the id of their manager.
 

Table: Bonus

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| empId       | int  |
| bonus       | int  |
+-------------+------+
empId is the column of unique values for this table.
empId is a foreign key (reference column) to empId from the Employee table.
Each row of this table contains the id of an employee and their respective bonus.
 

Write a solution to report the name and bonus amount of each employee who satisfies either of the following:

The employee has a bonus less than 1000.
The employee did not get any bonus.
Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Employee table:
+-------+--------+------------+--------+
| empId | name   | supervisor | salary |
+-------+--------+------------+--------+
| 3     | Brad   | null       | 4000   |
| 1     | John   | 3          | 1000   |
| 2     | Dan    | 3          | 2000   |
| 4     | Thomas | 3          | 4000   |
+-------+--------+------------+--------+
Bonus table:
+-------+-------+
| empId | bonus |
+-------+-------+
| 2     | 500   |
| 4     | 2000  |
+-------+-------+
Output:

/* Difficulty: Easy */
/* Topic: Joins */
/*
Approach:
1. We LEFT JOIN the Employee table to the Bonus table. This way we cover all empIds while highlighting the employees with no bonus.
2. We SELECT name and bonus WHERE bonus < 1000 OR bonus IS null
*/

SELECT e.name, b.bonus
FROM Employee e
LEFT JOIN Bonus b ON e.empId = b.empId
WHERE b.bonus < 1000 OR b.bonus IS NULL
